# NLP-to-LLM üî§

Welcome to **NLP-to-LLM**! where I document, implement, and practice concepts related to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from the ground up.

This repo is part of my preparation for **Data Science interviews**, focusing on foundational understanding and practical applications. The goal of the above codes is not to get the best results on a given dataset. The primary objective is to examine how a model is implemented. Kindly look into in-depth performance-enhancing techniques depending on your data.


## üìö Topics to be covered

The repository is structured into modules covering both theory and code:

1. **NLP Basics**
   - Tokenization
   - Stemming & Lemmatization
   - POS Tagging
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)

2. **Text Representations**
   - Bag of Words
   - TF-IDF
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

3. **Sequence Models**
   - RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs
   - Attention Mechanism

4. **Transformers & LLMs**
   - Transformer Architecture
   - BERT, GPT, and other LLMs
   - Fine-tuning Pretrained Models

5. **Projects & Case Studies**
   - Text Classification
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Question Answering
   - Prompt Engineering Examples
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (as needed)
## üìå Notes

- Code snippets are written to be simple and easy to understand.
- Notebooks include explanations and visualizations where applicable.
- Regularly updated as I continue learning!
